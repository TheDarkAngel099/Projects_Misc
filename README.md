# Miscellaneous Small Projects (projects_misc)

## 👋 Welcome!

This repository serves as a collection of various small or miscellaneous coding projects that I've worked on. Think of it as a digital sandbox or workshop where different ideas and experiments come to life. 🧪

## 📁 Projects Included

Here's a list of the projects currently available in this repository:

1.  **Clothing Classifier**
    * A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using **PyTorch** to classify images of clothing items. 👕👖👟
    * Trained on the popular **FashionMNIST** dataset.
    * Includes a Jupyter Notebook (`clothing_classifier.ipynb`) demonstrating the model definition, training loop, evaluation, and visualization of predictions.

## ✨ Future Additions

This repository is a work in progress! I'll be adding more small projects here as I develop them. Stay tuned! 🚀

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project folder (or notebook) should contain specific instructions if needed. Generally, you might need to install dependencies listed within the project's context (e.g., via `pip`).

Feel free to explore the code! 😊
